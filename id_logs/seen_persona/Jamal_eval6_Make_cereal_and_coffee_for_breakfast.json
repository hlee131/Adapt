Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located.

Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Jamal.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make cereal and coffee for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for cereal<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Found cereal_box_1 (carton of whole wheat shreds, contains whole_wheat_shreds_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_2 (carton of light swiss muesli, contains light_swiss_muesli) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_5 (a box of classic corn flakes, contains corn_flakes_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_4 (a box of cocoa puffs, contains cocoa_puffs_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_0 (carton of fruit loops, contains fruit_loops_cereal) in/on cabinet_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for coffee<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Found coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top) in/on living_room, pour_over_coffee_maker_0 (a chemex pour over coffee maker) in/on cabinet_1, coffee_2 (jar of instant coffee, contains instant_coffee_powder) in/on cabinet_0, coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine) in/on kitchen, coffee_0 (bag of regular ground coffee, contains coffee_grounds) in/on cabinet_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for fruit<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: fruit not found, but found strawberries_box_0 (a pint-sized box of organic strawberries, contains strawberry) in/on fridge_0, bread_2 (a sliced loaf of sweet banana and walnut bread, contains banana_bread_slice) in/on counter_1, cranberries_0 (pack of dry cranberries, contains dry_cranberries) in/on cabinet_0, oranges_bag_0 (a bag of navel oranges, contains navel_orange) in/on fridge_0, apple_1 (a green apple) in/on counter_1, tomato_1 (roma tomato) in/on fridge_0, tomato_2 (roma tomato) in/on fridge_0, almonds_0 (pack of raw almonds, contains raw_almonds) in/on cabinet_0, almonds_1 (pack of roasted and salted almonds, contains salted_almonds) in/on cabinet_0, mixed_berries_0 (a bag of frozen mixed berries, contains frozen_berry) in/on fridge_0, cereal_box_0 (carton of fruit loops, contains fruit_loops_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, lemon_0 (a lemon sliced in half) in/on fridge_0, banana_0 (a ripe banana) in/on counter_1, jam_0 (jar of mixed fruit jam, contains mixed_fruit_jam) in/on fridge_0.

Make sure to use this exactly once at the end of the task.\n\nFor a given task, you will provide the next action required to achieve a given task. e.g. \nAction: Move apple_0 from counter_0 to table_0.Do NOT repeat your last action.\nNote that you must do the task in a way that the user prefers. Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Jamal.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make cereal and coffee for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for cereal<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Found cereal_box_1 (carton of whole wheat shreds, contains whole_wheat_shreds_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_2 (carton of light swiss muesli, contains light_swiss_muesli) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_5 (a box of classic corn flakes, contains corn_flakes_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_4 (a box of cocoa puffs, contains cocoa_puffs_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_0 (carton of fruit loops, contains fruit_loops_cereal) in/on cabinet_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for coffee<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Found coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top) in/on living_room, pour_over_coffee_maker_0 (a chemex pour over coffee maker) in/on cabinet_1, coffee_2 (jar of instant coffee, contains instant_coffee_powder) in/on cabinet_0, coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine) in/on kitchen, coffee_0 (bag of regular ground coffee, contains coffee_grounds) in/on cabinet_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for fruit<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: fruit not found, but found strawberries_box_0 (a pint-sized box of organic strawberries, contains strawberry) in/on fridge_0, bread_2 (a sliced loaf of sweet banana and walnut bread, contains banana_bread_slice) in/on counter_1, cranberries_0 (pack of dry cranberries, contains dry_cranberries) in/on cabinet_0, oranges_bag_0 (a bag of navel oranges, contains navel_orange) in/on fridge_0, apple_1 (a green apple) in/on counter_1, tomato_1 (roma tomato) in/on fridge_0, tomato_2 (roma tomato) in/on fridge_0, almonds_0 (pack of raw almonds, contains raw_almonds) in/on cabinet_0, almonds_1 (pack of roasted and salted almonds, contains salted_almonds) in/on cabinet_0, mixed_berries_0 (a bag of frozen mixed berries, contains frozen_berry) in/on fridge_0, cereal_box_0 (carton of fruit loops, contains fruit_loops_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, lemon_0 (a lemon sliced in half) in/on fridge_0, banana_0 (a ripe banana) in/on counter_1, jam_0 (jar of mixed fruit jam, contains mixed_fruit_jam) in/on fridge_0.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Jamal.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make cereal and coffee for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for cereal<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Found cereal_box_1 (carton of whole wheat shreds, contains whole_wheat_shreds_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_2 (carton of light swiss muesli, contains light_swiss_muesli) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_5 (a box of classic corn flakes, contains corn_flakes_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_4 (a box of cocoa puffs, contains cocoa_puffs_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_0 (carton of fruit loops, contains fruit_loops_cereal) in/on cabinet_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for coffee<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Found coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top) in/on living_room, pour_over_coffee_maker_0 (a chemex pour over coffee maker) in/on cabinet_1, coffee_2 (jar of instant coffee, contains instant_coffee_powder) in/on cabinet_0, coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine) in/on kitchen, coffee_0 (bag of regular ground coffee, contains coffee_grounds) in/on cabinet_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for fruit<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: fruit not found, but found strawberries_box_0 (a pint-sized box of organic strawberries, contains strawberry) in/on fridge_0, bread_2 (a sliced loaf of sweet banana and walnut bread, contains banana_bread_slice) in/on counter_1, cranberries_0 (pack of dry cranberries, contains dry_cranberries) in/on cabinet_0, oranges_bag_0 (a bag of navel oranges, contains navel_orange) in/on fridge_0, apple_1 (a green apple) in/on counter_1, tomato_1 (roma tomato) in/on fridge_0, tomato_2 (roma tomato) in/on fridge_0, almonds_0 (pack of raw almonds, contains raw_almonds) in/on cabinet_0, almonds_1 (pack of roasted and salted almonds, contains salted_almonds) in/on cabinet_0, mixed_berries_0 (a bag of frozen mixed berries, contains frozen_berry) in/on fridge_0, cereal_box_0 (carton of fruit loops, contains fruit_loops_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, lemon_0 (a lemon sliced in half) in/on fridge_0, banana_0 (a ripe banana) in/on counter_1, jam_0 (jar of mixed fruit jam, contains mixed_fruit_jam) in/on fridge_0.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Jamal.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make cereal and coffee for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for cereal<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Found cereal_box_1 (carton of whole wheat shreds, contains whole_wheat_shreds_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_2 (carton of light swiss muesli, contains light_swiss_muesli) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_5 (a box of classic corn flakes, contains corn_flakes_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_4 (a box of cocoa puffs, contains cocoa_puffs_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, cereal_box_0 (carton of fruit loops, contains fruit_loops_cereal) in/on cabinet_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for coffee<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Found coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top) in/on living_room, pour_over_coffee_maker_0 (a chemex pour over coffee maker) in/on cabinet_1, coffee_2 (jar of instant coffee, contains instant_coffee_powder) in/on cabinet_0, coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine) in/on kitchen, coffee_0 (bag of regular ground coffee, contains coffee_grounds) in/on cabinet_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for fruit<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: fruit not found, but found strawberries_box_0 (a pint-sized box of organic strawberries, contains strawberry) in/on fridge_0, bread_2 (a sliced loaf of sweet banana and walnut bread, contains banana_bread_slice) in/on counter_1, cranberries_0 (pack of dry cranberries, contains dry_cranberries) in/on cabinet_0, oranges_bag_0 (a bag of navel oranges, contains navel_orange) in/on fridge_0, apple_1 (a green apple) in/on counter_1, tomato_1 (roma tomato) in/on fridge_0, tomato_2 (roma tomato) in/on fridge_0, almonds_0 (pack of raw almonds, contains raw_almonds) in/on cabinet_0, almonds_1 (pack of roasted and salted almonds, contains salted_almonds) in/on cabinet_0, mixed_berries_0 (a bag of frozen mixed berries, contains frozen_berry) in/on fridge_0, cereal_box_0 (carton of fruit loops, contains fruit_loops_cereal) in/on cabinet_0, lemon_0 (a lemon sliced in half) in/on fridge_0, banana_0 (a ripe banana) in/on counter_1, jam_0 (jar of mixed fruit jam, contains mixed_fruit_jam) in/on fridge_0.
