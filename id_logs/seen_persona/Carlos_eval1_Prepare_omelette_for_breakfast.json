Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located.

Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Carlos.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Prepare omelette for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for eggs<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Found egg_6 (brown egg) in/on egg_carton_0, egg_carton_0 (carton of 12 eggs) in/on fridge_0, egg_5 (brown egg) in/on egg_carton_0, egg_2 (brown egg) in/on egg_carton_0, liquid_egg_0 (a box of vegan liquid egg substitute, contains vegan_egg_substitute) in/on fridge_0, egg_1 (brown egg) in/on egg_carton_0, egg_7 (brown egg) in/on egg_carton_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for cheese<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Found cheese_2 (pack of goat cheese, contains goat_cheese) in/on fridge_0, cheese_1 (block of part skim mozzarella cheese, contains mozzarella_cheese) in/on fridge_0, cheese_3 (block of aged cheddar cheese, contains cheddar_cheese) in/on fridge_0, cheese_4 (slices of vegan cheese, contains vegan_cheese_slice) in/on fridge_0, cheese_dip_0 (jar of cheese dip, contains cheese_dip) in/on fridge_0, cheese_0 (slices of american cheese, contains american_cheese_slice) in/on fridge_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for vegetables<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: vegetable not found, but found sunflower_seeds_0 (pack of sunflower seeds, contains sunflower_seeds) in/on cabinet_0, cucumber_0 (cucumber) in/on fridge_0, bowl_4 (white ceramic salad bowl) in/on cabinet_1, bowl_5 (white ceramic salad bowl) in/on cabinet_1, bowl_6 (white ceramic salad bowl) in/on cabinet_1, bowl_7 (white ceramic salad bowl) in/on cabinet_1, tomato_1 (roma tomato) in/on fridge_0, potato_0 (sweet potato) in/on fridge_0, rosemary (box of fresh rosemary, contains fresh_rosemary) in/on fridge_0, onion_0 (yellow onion) in/on fridge_0, onion_powder_0 (small bottle of onion powder, contains onion_powder) in/on spice_cabinet_0, oil_bottle_1 (bottle of vegetable oil, contains vegetable_oil) in/on counter_0, beans_0 (can of black beans, contains black_beans) in/on cabinet_0, beans_1 (can of pinto beans, contains pinto_beans) in/on cabinet_0, beans_2 (can of garbanzo beans, contains garbanzo_beans) in/on cabinet_0, banana_0 (a ripe banana) in/on counter_1, basil (box of fresh basil, contains fresh_basil) in/on fridge_0.

You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located.
