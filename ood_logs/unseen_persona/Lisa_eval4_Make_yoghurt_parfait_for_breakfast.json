Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Lisa.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make yoghurt parfait for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of yoghurt would you like to use for the parfait?

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Lisa.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make yoghurt parfait for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of yoghurt would you like to use for the parfait?

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Lisa.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make yoghurt parfait for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of yoghurt would you like to use for the parfait?

Since I'm on a vegan diet, I would prefer to use a vegan alternative to yoghurt. We have a cup of vegan cashew-based yoghurt in the fridge. That would be perfect for the parfait.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of granola or crunch would you like to add to the parfait? We can use store-bought granola, homemade granola, or something else like chopped nuts or seeds<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm glad you're thinking of adding some crunch to the parfait. Since I'm on a vegan diet, I'd prefer to use a vegan granola. We have a box of gluten-free granola in the cabinet. That would be great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for berries<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Found strawberries_box_0 (a pint-sized box of organic strawberries, contains strawberry) in/on fridge_0, blueberries_box_0 (a pint-sized box of organic blueberries, contains blueberry) in/on fridge_0, mixed_berries_0 (a bag of frozen mixed berries, contains frozen_berry) in/on fridge_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Which type of berries would you like to use in the parfait?

Since I mentioned that a side of berries is a nice complement for any breakfast meal, I'd be happy with any of the options. Usually, I'm flexible with berries, but if I had to choose, I'd say the fresh strawberries would be a great choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to add some sliced banana to the parfait? We can use a ripe banana for added natural sweetness and creamy texture\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nActually, I don't think I'd like to add sliced banana to the parfait. I have a ripe banana on the counter, but I'd rather not use it in the parfait. How about we save it for a different snack or breakfast option?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What is your preferred method for preparing the fresh strawberries? We can chop them, slice them, or leave them whole, depending on how you like them in your parfait\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm glad you're thinking of preparing the fresh strawberries for the parfait. Since I'm on a vegan diet, I'd prefer to keep the strawberries as is, so we can just wash and pat them dry. No need to chop or slice them, just leave them whole.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to add some toppings to the parfait, such as shredded coconut, chopped nuts, or seeds? Or would you like to keep it simple with just the cashew-based yoghurt, granola, and fresh strawberries?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI think I'd like to add some chopped nuts to the parfait. Since I mentioned that a side of nuts is a nice complement for any sweet breakfast, I think chopped nuts would be a great addition. We have some salted pistachios in the cabinet that would be perfect.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like me to serve the yoghurt parfait in a glass or a bowl? And would you like it to be served chilled, straight away, or do you want me to put it in the freezer for a few minutes to set the flavours?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'd like to serve the yoghurt parfait in a bowl.

Make sure to use this exactly once at the end of the task.\n\nFor a given task, you will provide the next action required to achieve a given task. e.g. \nAction: Move apple_0 from counter_0 to table_0.Do NOT repeat your last action.\nNote that you must do the task in a way that the user prefers. Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Lisa.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make yoghurt parfait for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of yoghurt would you like to use for the parfait? We have Greek yoghurt, regular yoghurt, or coconut yoghurt as options<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm glad you're excited to make a yoghurt parfait for me. Since I'm on a vegan diet, I would prefer to use a vegan alternative to yoghurt. We have a cup of vegan cashew-based yoghurt in the fridge. That would be perfect for the parfait.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of granola or crunch would you like to add to the parfait? We can use store-bought granola, homemade granola, or something else like chopped nuts or seeds<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm glad you're thinking of adding some crunch to the parfait. Since I'm on a vegan diet, I'd prefer to use a vegan granola. We have a box of gluten-free granola in the cabinet. That would be great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Look for berries<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Found strawberries_box_0 (a pint-sized box of organic strawberries, contains strawberry) in/on fridge_0, blueberries_box_0 (a pint-sized box of organic blueberries, contains blueberry) in/on fridge_0, mixed_berries_0 (a bag of frozen mixed berries, contains frozen_berry) in/on fridge_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Which type of berries would you like to use in the parfait? We have fresh strawberries, fresh blueberries, or frozen mixed berries as options<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm glad you found some berries for the parfait. Since I mentioned that a side of berries is a nice complement for any breakfast meal, I'd be happy with any of the options. Usually, I'm flexible with berries, but if I had to choose, I'd say the fresh strawberries would be a great choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to add some sliced banana to the parfait? We can use a ripe banana for added natural sweetness and creamy texture\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nActually, I don't think I'd like to add sliced banana to the parfait. I have a ripe banana on the counter, but I'd rather not use it in the parfait. How about we save it for a different snack or breakfast option?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What is your preferred method for preparing the fresh strawberries? We can chop them, slice them, or leave them whole, depending on how you like them in your parfait\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm glad you're thinking of preparing the fresh strawberries for the parfait. Since I'm on a vegan diet, I'd prefer to keep the strawberries as is, so we can just wash and pat them dry. No need to chop or slice them, just leave them whole.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to add some toppings to the parfait, such as shredded coconut, chopped nuts, or seeds? Or would you like to keep it simple with just the cashew-based yoghurt, granola, and fresh strawberries?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI think I'd like to add some chopped nuts to the parfait. Since I mentioned that a side of nuts is a nice complement for any sweet breakfast, I think chopped nuts would be a great addition. We have some salted pistachios in the cabinet that would be perfect.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like me to serve the yoghurt parfait in a glass or a bowl? And would you like it to be served chilled, straight away, or do you want me to put it in the freezer for a few minutes to set the flavours?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'd like to serve the yoghurt parfait in a bowl. Since I'm planning to eat it at the standing desk to start my workday, a bowl would be more convenient. And I'd like it to be served chilled, straight away. No need to put it in the freezer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Wash the object strawberries_box_0 to get clean_strawberries<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Action Failed! cannot wash strawberries_box_0, because strawberries_box_0 (a pint-sized box of organic strawberries) is not edible. Use 'pour' or 'move_from' to extract one of the contents (strawberry) first.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What is your preferred method for preparing the chopped nuts? We can toast them in a pan for a few minutes to bring out their flavor, or we can leave them raw<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nActually, I'd prefer to leave the chopped nuts raw. I'm on a vegan diet, and I'd like to keep the nuts in their natural state. Toasting them might change their flavor and texture, and I'd rather not do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou have not made anything yet.\nWhat is the next step to complete the task: Make yoghurt parfait for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction:",

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Lisa.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make yoghurt parfait for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of yoghurt would you like to use for the parfait?

That would be perfect for the parfait.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of granola or crunch would you like to add to the parfait?

Since I'm on a vegan diet, I would prefer to use a vegan alternative to yoghurt. We have a cup of vegan cashew-based yoghurt in the fridge. That would be perfect for the parfait.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of granola or crunch would you like to add to the parfait?

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Lisa.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter, open)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make yoghurt parfait for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of yoghurt would you like to use for the parfait?

That would be perfect for the parfait.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of granola or crunch would you like to add to the parfait?

No need to chop or slice them, just leave them whole.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to add some toppings to the parfait, such as shredded coconut, chopped nuts, or seeds?

We have some salted pistachios in the cabinet that would be perfect.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like me to serve the yoghurt parfait in a glass or a bowl?

Since I'm planning to eat it at the standing desk to start my workday, a bowl would be more convenient. And I'd like it to be served chilled, straight away. No need to put it in the freezer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Wash the object strawberries_box_0 to get clean_strawberries<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Action Failed! cannot wash strawberries_box_0, because strawberries_box_0 (a pint-sized box of organic strawberries) is not edible.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer.

That would be perfect for the parfait.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of granola or crunch would you like to add to the parfait?

Since I'm on a vegan diet, I'd prefer to keep the strawberries as is, so we can just wash and pat them dry. No need to chop or slice them, just leave them whole.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to add some toppings to the parfait, such as shredded coconut, chopped nuts, or seeds?

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer.

We can slice it and serve it on the side, or we can use it as a topping for the yoghurt parfait\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nActually, I think I'd rather not use the ripe banana in the yoghurt parfait. I mentioned earlier that I'd rather save it for a different snack or breakfast option. How about we just slice it and serve it on the side? That way, I can enjoy it as a separate snack if I want to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like some sliced almonds or shredded coconut sprinkled on top of the yoghurt parfait as a garnish?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI think I'd like some sliced almonds sprinkled on top of the yoghurt parfait. Since I mentioned that a side of nuts is a nice complement for any sweet breakfast, I think sliced almonds would be a great addition to the parfait.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Clean the object dish_soap_0 to get clean_dishSoap<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Action Failed! cannot clean dish_soap_0, because dish_soap_0 (bottle of dish soap) is not edible.

We can start by placing a layer of gluten-free granola at the bottom of the bowl, then adding a layer of cashew-based yoghurt, some fresh strawberries, and finally topping it with some chopped nuts and a sprinkle of sliced almonds\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYes, I'm ready to start assembling the yoghurt parfait.

Make sure to use this exactly once at the end of the task.\n\nFor a given task, you will provide the next action required to achieve a given task. e.g. \nAction: Move apple_0 from counter_0 to table_0.Do NOT repeat your last action.\nNote that you must do the task in a way that the user prefers. Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer.

Since I mentioned that I prefer my coffee black without any added sugars or creamers, I'd like it to be made with just the espresso machine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Turn on espresso_machine_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: espresso_machine_0 is now on<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"How many shots of espresso would you like in your cup of coffee?

I mentioned earlier that I'd rather save it for a different snack or breakfast option. How about we just slice it and serve it on the side? That way, I can enjoy it as a separate snack if I want to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like some sliced almonds or shredded coconut sprinkled on top of the yoghurt parfait as a garnish?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI think I'd like some sliced almonds sprinkled on top of the yoghurt parfait.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Lisa.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine, on)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter, open)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make yoghurt parfait for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What type of yoghurt would you like to use for the parfait?

Let's just assemble it now. We can start by placing a layer of gluten-free granola at the bottom of the bowl, then add a layer of cashew-based yoghurt, some fresh strawberries, and finally top it with some chopped nuts and a sprinkle of sliced almonds. That sounds like a great parfait!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What is your preferred method for preparing the sliced apple that we are using as a topping? We can simply slice it thinly, or we can cook it in a pan with a little bit of cinnamon and lemon juice to bring out its flavor\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI think we can just slice the apple thinly. I mentioned earlier that I'd like to keep the apple in its natural state, so cooking it in a pan isn't necessary. A simple slice will be fine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Assemble the object yoghurt_0 to get yoghurt_parfait_0<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation: Action Failed! cannot assemble yoghurt_0, because yoghurt_0 (pack of plain non-fat greek yoghurt) is not edible. Use 'pour' or 'move_from' to extract one of the contents (greek_yoghurt) first.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"What is a good time for you to eat your yoghurt parfait?
