Make sure to use this exactly once at the end of the task.\n\nFor a given task, you will provide the next action required to achieve a given task. e.g. \nAction: Move apple_0 from counter_0 to table_0.Do NOT repeat your last action.\nNote that you must do the task in a way that the user prefers. Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Be sure to look for objects one-at-a-time. e.g. Look for milk\n- Move <X> to <Y>: move an object X from wherever it currently is to the furniture or location Y. e.g. Move plate_0 to table_2\n- Mix all items in <X> to get <Y>: mix items that exist in a container, typically to create a new entity. e.g. Mix all items in bowl_0 to get cake_batter\n- Cook items in <X> to get <Y>: cook something in a stove, oven or other such appliance to create a cooked version of that entity. e.g. Cook items in pan_0 to get scrambled_eggs\n- Chop <X> to get <Y>: chop items on a cutting board to create a chopped version of that entity. e.g. Chop apple_0 to get chopped_apple\n- Pour <X> from <Y> to <Z>: pour an entity X from one container Y to another container Z. e.g. Pour milk from milk_carton_0 to mug_0\n- Move <X> from <Y> to <Z>: move content X of container Y to another container Z. e.g. Move apple from apple_bag_0 to bowl_1\n- <X> items in <Y> to get <Z>: freeform action to change object state, such as whisk, heat, blend, etc. e.g. whisk items in pan_0 to get custard, brew coffee_grounds to get brewed_coffee etc.\n- <X> the object <Y> to get <Z>: freeform action to change object state, such as chop, peel, crack, wash, wipe, etc. e.g. chop the object tomato_1 to get finely_chopped_tomato, chop the object onion_0 to get sliced_onion, crack the object egg_4 to get cracked_egg, etc.\n- Ask <X>: ask a freeform question to the user to decide between multiple options and make sure you adhere to the user's preferences. e.g. Ask \"Would you like the eggs sunny-side-up or scrambled?\"\n- Declare Done: indicate that the task is complete. Make sure to use this exactly once at the end of the task.\n\nFor a given task, you will provide the next action required to achieve a given task. e.g. \nAction: Move apple_0 from counter_0 to table_0.Do NOT repeat your last action.\nNote that you must do the task in a way that the user prefers. Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Make sure to use this exactly once at the end of the task.\n\nFor a given task, you will provide the next action required to achieve a given task. e.g. \nAction: Move apple_0 from counter_0 to table_0.Do NOT repeat your last action.\nNote that you must do the task in a way that the user prefers. Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information.

Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle, on)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle, on)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Make sure to use this exactly once at the end of the task.\n\nFor a given task, you will provide the next action required to achieve a given task. e.g. \nAction: Move apple_0 from counter_0 to table_0.Do NOT repeat your last action.\nNote that you must do the task in a way that the user prefers. Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle, on)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Make sure to use this exactly once at the end of the task.\n\nFor a given task, you will provide the next action required to achieve a given task. e.g. \nAction: Move apple_0 from counter_0 to table_0.Do NOT repeat your last action.\nNote that you must do the task in a way that the user prefers. Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle, on)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle, on)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle, on)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information.

Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Mark.\n\nYou will be performing tasks in a house with the following layout:\n- kitchen (kitchen)\n  - stove_0 (stove)\n  - oven_0 (oven)\n  - microwave_0 (microwave)\n  - coffee_machine_0 (a drip coffee machine)\n  - espresso_machine_0 (an espresso machine)\n  - kettle_0 (an electric kettle, on)\n  - toaster_0 (a classic 2-bread toaster)\n  - dishwasher_0 (dishwasher)\n  - island_0 (kitchen island next to countertop with two seats)\n  - island_chair_0 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - island_chair_1 (bar height chair next to kitchen island)\n  - counter_0 (kitchen countertop next to the stove)\n  - counter_1 (kitchen countertop next to the sink)\n  - cabinet_0 (left kitchen cabinet above the counter)\n  - cabinet_1 (right kitchen cabinet above the counter, open, open)\n  - cabinet_2 (tall kitchen cabinet)\n  - cabinet_3 (kitchen cabinet below the counter)\n  - sink_1 (standard kitchen sink, contains water)\n  - fridge_0 (fridge)\n  - drawer_0 (top kitchen drawer to left of the stove)\n  - drawer_1 (top kitchen drawer to right of the stove)\n  - spice_cabinet_0 (small cabinet for spice bottles and related items)\n- dining_room (dining room)\n  - table_0 (wooden dining table with four chairs)\n  - chair_1 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_2 (wooden dining chair)\n  - chair_3 (wooden dining chair)\n- bedroom (bedroom)\n  - bed_0 (queen-sized bed with a wooden frame)\n  - dresser_0 (wooden dresser with six drawers)\n  - nightstand_0 (wooden nightstand with two drawers)\n  - lamp_0 (bedside lamp with a white shade)\n  - desk_0 (work desk)\n- living_room (living room)\n  - chair_0 (recliner with a black leather upholstery)\n  - sofa_0 (three-seater sofa with a brown leather upholstery)\n  - coffee_table_0 (wooden coffee table with a glass top)\n  - tv_0 (flat-screen TV with a 55-inch screen)\n- bathroom (bathroom)\n  - toilet_0 (white porcelain toilet)\n  - sink_0 (white porcelain sink with a chrome faucet, contains water)\n  - mirror_0 (large mirror with a wooden frame)\n  - shower_0 (glass-enclosed shower with a chrome showerhead)\n- patio (outdoor patio area)\n  - table_1 (small patio table)\n\nWhat is the next action required to achieve the task: Make tea and eggs for breakfast?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAction: Ask \"Would you like to have milk with your tea and eggs?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>environment<|end_header_id|>\n\nObservation:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI'm not sure what type of milk Mark would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information.

Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information.
