Make sure to use this exactly once at the end of the task.\n\nFor a given task, you will provide the next action required to achieve a given task. e.g. \nAction: Move apple_0 from counter_0 to table_0.Do NOT repeat your last action.\nNote that you must do the task in a way that the user prefers. Think of different variations, modifications, sides, etc. applicable to the given task, and do the task in a way that you think the user would prefer. You have interacted with this person before, so use prior information you have about the person to complete the task as much as possible. Only ask questions if you don't have any related information. Be sure to only ask about their preferences. Think about whether multiple options are available for a particular ingredient, and think creatively about toppings and sides that the person might prefer. Do not ask for help in finding things; the user may not know what objects exist in the environment and where they might be located. Ask general questions to learn about the user's preferences which can prove useful in preparing future breakfasts in addition to the one at hand.\n\nYou have no prior information about Jamal.\n\nYou
